This example is based on Keith Packard's 2003 paper for
the Linux Symposium Proceedings.

The easiest way to do a bibliography is to use BiBTeX.
In the body of the paper, you \cite{} various references.
The citation name is the first name following the opening
curly brace in the .bib file.  For example, with the list below,
I could \cite{autoconf} and \cite{freetype2}.

Near the end of your main .tex file, you include a section like so:
\begin{flushleft}
\bibliography{keithp}
\bibliographystyle{plain}
\end{flushleft}
(this comes *before* \end{document}.)

And in a separate file whose name matches the \bibliography{}
declaration above (e.g., keithp.bib in this case), you define all
the references.  Note that \url is a valid way to typeset web
references.  

Note that the makefiles are already set up to process this form
of bibliography, so using it is indeed easy.  (It's also one
reason why the input files are processed multiple times, though.)

Here are some sample entries for various types

Here's another way of handling bibliographies; it does
not use a .bib file, but includes the items at the end
of the paper, before \end{document}.

Each item has the format
\bibitem[printName]{citeName} details

The "printName" will be printed at the point of your citation,
and again in the list of references.  The "citeName" is what
you use in the source to create the citation.  For example,
using the first entry below, I could \cite{menyhart} and
have the author's name print out properly in the appropriate
places.

The bibliography below comes from Tony Luck's 2003 Linux
Symposium paper:
