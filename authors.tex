Sometimes there are more than two authors, or the authors wish to have
a slightly different layout of names.  That's fine, and here are some
examples.  Just keep the font sizes and families consistent.
Note that we use Name, Institution, and Email address; postal addresses
are generally omitted for this conference.  (Examples below use
fictitional email addresses, although they are otherwise from
the 2003 Linux Symposium.)
